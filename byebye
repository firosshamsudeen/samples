Hello Everyone,

Today is my last day with UST Global. I had joined this company as a fresher way back in 2015 and Equifax had been my one and only 
account in this 2 years and 10 months. I am really very grateful to have such wonderful teammates. Had it not been for them, being a 
tad bit successful would have still been a far-fetched dream. I would specifically thank my Managers and Team Leads (yes, in plural. 
I had more than one ). It’s because they were not just professionals out here. They acted as my mentor and guide at times. 
I did share other thoughts with them apart from job life. Whatever I learned here was because of them. And it is definitely going 
to help me in future. I want to wish them success in their future ventures.

Yes, I am happy that I am moving to a new place altogether but I am going to miss this place. I would miss interacting with whomever 
I used to. There are a lot of special moments which I can never put down on paper. Well, the truth is I am feeling nostalgic as this 
was my first company and I spent a pretty long time here. Also, I would like to thank my friends and alpha-mates for being there always.

Anyway, I would wish everyone of you a happy and successful life ahead. And, if anyone of you ever come down to Bangalore and wish 
to re-connect please reach me out to me on my mobile number. I promise, it won’t change . Till then Keep rocking !!

Hasta La Vista !!

Dated Forever,
