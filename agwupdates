Hi Team,

PFB:  the discussion points with Rakesh – Today’s call
Rakesh will discuss with the client to get a more clear picture of the overall process and will be shared with the team during Wednesday’s call at 9:30 am.
The entire team should be present. 
No status call on Wednesday.


Web Manager Mode
1.	The web mananger mode is introduced in RBA for web mangers (supervisors) to view and update employee PIM info.
2.	A new page (similar to CSR) will be implemented or reused where the requesting user can view or update the details of target user.
Here target user can be same or different than the requesting user.
3.	The details will be inserted to a new table called sss_third_person_pim.
4.	Two new columns are added to the auth_session table (rsa_lightbox) i.e., target_user_id and target_employer_code.
5.	Two new APIs get_third_person_pim and set_third_person_pim (names not sure) are in progress.
6.	There will be a new screen to view and update the phone, email and address (single fields, multiple entry not supported).
7.	The other tables related to PIM will be :
a.	SSS_loader_PIM – to store the employee data given by employer (loaded to DB using loaders application)
b.	Account_recovery_PIM – user (employee) can store their primary phone no, email and address for account recovery. (table name not yet confirmed)

8.	The RAE engine will replace the RSA engine. It will check the employer type (Hamilton, HamiltonV1 or Legacy) and will give the response action as “allow” if the user is authenticated.
9.	The “RBA_Authentication_Flow” column in SSS_Employer will have three values : Hamilton, HamiltonV1 and Legacy; determines the flow.
10.	The RAE engine will provide the PIM info like phone or email or address or all of these (specified as challenges or channels).
11.	If an employee has 5 or 6 distinct phone numbers, the RAE will return only 1 or 2 of these which it treats as trusted info.
12.	In auth_session table, the sss_role column will be resized from 32 to 64 so as to accept multiple roles. It can be comma separated or appended using “+”. (Yet to decide).

CSR
1.	There will be a new button introduced in CSR to pick the user to new screen with employee PII information.
2.	The customer care agent can update the user provided PII info in that screen and finally sends an OTP to validate the information.
3.	The information will be passed to SSS which will be again verified by RAE engine.

OTP POSTAL

1.	The current OTP screens has been scrapped for OTP Postal.
2.	As per the new functionality, when an user enters the user_id in RBA, the rsa_lookup_user will  return the otp_status.
3.	Then the user will be redirected to PIN page.
4.	Here the user can enter either the password or the OTP.
5.	The OTP will be verified based on the otp_status ??? (yet to confirm)
6.	For invalid password or OTP, the failed attempt counts in both the tables will be incremented.
7.	The user will be risk locked if failed max allowed attempts.
8.	The signon_user api will have the changes now for otp_status instead of rsa_lookup_user.

Thanks and Regards,
Resmi
